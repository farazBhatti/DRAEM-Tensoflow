# DRAEM-Tensoflow
A discriminatively trained reconstruction embedding for surface anomaly detection.
This is tensorflow implementation of [DRAEM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.07610v2.pdf).DRÃ†M (Discriminatively Trained Reconstruction Embedding for Surface Anomaly Detection) is a method for detecting anomalies in surfaces, 
such as defects or damage, using a combination of reconstruction and classification techniques.
